Thanks for downloading the resource, we offer two versions of this resource, one to list it in ESX, VRP, and other simmilar frameworks, and also we have released a standalone version, for servers that do not support frameworks.

If you like the resources that MayhemStudios put out, consider joining the discord or staring some of the repoisitories, I love interacting with the community and chatting around with people.

If there is an issue, please make a issue about it on the repository, or better off, creating a ticket in the discord.

### How to get support the quickist?
Creating a ticket on my development hub is the fastest way that i will respond to a support request, please make sure following all the rules, however, creating a ticket automaticly pings me, and i instantly respond to pings over on my discord, or atleast when i can.
